# Zepto_Dataset_SQL
ðŸ“Œ Introduction
This project focuses on analyzing product-level data from Zepto, an online grocery delivery service, using SQL.
The aim was to explore product availability, pricing trends, discount patterns, and inventory distribution in order to uncover business insights that could guide pricing strategies, stock management, and customer offers.
The work involved:
â€¢	Setting up a well-structured SQL table for the dataset.
â€¢	Performing data cleaning and transformation.
â€¢	Running exploratory queries to understand product distribution and stock patterns.
â€¢	Conducting analytical queries to answer business-oriented questions.

ðŸ“‚ Dataset Description
The dataset includes structured product-level details with the following key attributes:
Column Name	Description
sky_id	Unique product identifier
category	Product category (e.g., Dairy, Snacks, Beverages)
name	Product name
mrp	Maximum Retail Price
discountpercent	Discount applied (%)
availableQuantity	Current quantity available
discountedSellingPrice	Price after discount
weightIngms	Weight of the product in grams
outofStock	Boolean indicating if product is out of stock
quantity	Quantity sold or packaged

ðŸ›  Steps Performed
1. Table Creation & Schema Definition
â€¢	Defined a SQL table with proper data types for each column.
â€¢	Ensured sky_id is the primary key.
2. Data Exploration
â€¢	Counted total product entries in the dataset.
â€¢	Viewed sample records for an overview.
â€¢	Checked for missing values across columns.
â€¢	Listed unique product categories in alphabetical order.
â€¢	Counted products that are in stock vs. out of stock.
â€¢	Detected products listed multiple times with the same name.
3. Data Cleaning
â€¢	Removed products with mrp = 0 or discountedSellingPrice = 0.
â€¢	Converted prices from paise to rupees for accurate calculations.
4. Analysis Queries
â€¢	Q1: Top 10 products by highest discount percentage.
â€¢	Q2: High MRP items (> â‚¹300) that are out of stock.
â€¢	Q3: Total revenue generated per category.
â€¢	Q4: Products with MRP > â‚¹500 and discount < 10%.
â€¢	Q5: Top 5 categories offering highest average discount %.
â€¢	Q6: Price per gram for products above 100g (best value ranking).
â€¢	Q7: Categorized products into low, medium, bulk based on weight.
â€¢	Q8: Total inventory weight per category.

ðŸ“Š Key Insights
â€¢	Some categories consistently provide higher average discounts, which could drive promotional campaigns.
â€¢	Several high-priced products remain out of stock â€” potential lost revenue opportunity.
â€¢	Bulk products generally offer better cost efficiency per gram.
â€¢	Inventory weight distribution varies â€” some categories dominate stock capacity.

ðŸ–¥ Tools Used
â€¢	SQL (PostgreSQL / MySQL compatible syntax)
â€¢	SQL features used: GROUP BY, ORDER BY, DISTINCT, CASE, ROUND, aggregate functions (SUM, AVG), and conditional filtering (WHERE, HAVING).
ðŸ“– How to Use
1.	Import the dataset into your SQL database.
2.	Create the table using the provided schema in sql_zepto_data_project.sql.
3.	Run the data cleaning queries before analysis.
4.	Execute analysis queries one by one to reproduce insights.
5.	Modify filters (price, discount, category) to explore additional scenarios.
